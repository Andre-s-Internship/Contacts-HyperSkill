Instructions:

1. Run Contacts file.
2. Navigate through the menu to add, list, search, count contacts. You can exit the program only by typing exit.
3. Start by adding contact, so you can test other parts of the program too, because at first the phone book is empty
4. While searching, you can enter any char sequence, and the program will iterate over all of your contacts and list all
the contacts which contain that sequence. Searching is not case-sensitive.
5. When listing or searching the first menu option is [number], after entering a number from the listed items,
the program will show full information about the selected contact.
